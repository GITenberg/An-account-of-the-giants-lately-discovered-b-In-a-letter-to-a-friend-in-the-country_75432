  <p><em>Dear Will</em>,</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THOUGH People in the Country are enough disposed to believe Wonders,
    yet are they prudently apt to suspend giving Credit to all that are
    sent from <em>London</em>, except of a political Cast. You good Folks
    still believe in an uninterrupted Generation of Patriots; and though
    they so seldom come to Years <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>of Maturity, you trust in them as fast as
    they are produced in St. <em>Stephen</em>'s Chapel. For other monstrous
    Births, you are fonder of them, the farther they come. Ghosts and
    Witches are entirely of your own Growth. Excepting the famous Ghost of
    a Sound in <em>Cock-Lane</em>, from which the Methodists expected such a
    rich Harvest, (for what might not a rising Church promise itself from
    such well imagined Nonsense as the Apparition of a Noise?) I think
    many, many Years have elapsed, since the Capital could boast of having
    regenerated a Spirit. Your Sagacity will therefore incline you to doubt
    the marvellous Account I am going to give you of a new discovered Race
    of Giants.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you will take the Relation for some political Allegory, or
    think it a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>new vamped Edition of <em>Swift</em>'s Brobdignags. My good
    Friend, it is neither the one nor the other; though I must own, a
    political Mystery, and a wonderful one too, for it is really kept a
    Secret.—The very Crew of the Ship who saw Five Hundred of these lofty
    Personages, did not utter a word of the Matter for a whole Year; and
    even now, that a general Idea has taken wind, can scarce be brought to
    give any Particulars to their most intimate Friends.</p>

  <p>All that the Public can yet learn, is, that Captain <em>Byron</em> and
    his Men have seen on the Coast of <em>Patagonia</em> Five Hundred Giants
    on Horseback. Giants? you will cry, what do you call Giants? why,
    my Friend, not Men of Fifty or an Hundred Feet high, yet still very
    personable Giants, and much taller than any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>Individual ever exhibited
    at <em>Charing Cross</em>. Come, what do you think of Nine or Ten Feet
    high? and what do you think of Five Hundred such? will Mrs. —— cry,
    "pish, That is no Giant, it is only a well made Man?"</p>

  <p>I am told, for I am no reader of Travels, that this Gigantic Nation
    was known to exist as early as the discovery of that Continent:
    That Sir <em>John Narborough</em> mentions them; and of late Years,
    <em>Maupertuis</em>. The <em>Spaniards</em> assert that they have long been
    acquainted with their existence—So they you see can keep a Secret
    too. But the Reasons given why we know so little of the Matter, are,
    that few Ships ever touch on that Coast, standing more out to Sea, in
    order to double the <em>Cape</em>, and that these Giants are a roving
    Nation, and seldom come <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>down to the Coast; and then I suppose, only
    <em>to bob for Whales</em>.</p>

  <p>You will be eager to know a great deal more than I can tell you; but
    thus much I think is allowed. That Captain <em>Byron</em> being on that
    Coast, saw a Body of Men at a distance on very small Horses; as they
    approached, he perceived that the Horses were common-sized Horses, but
    that the Riders were enormously tall, though I do not hear that their
    Legs trailed much on the Ground. This was fine Game for a Man sent on
    Discoveries. The Captain and part of his Crew immediately landed, on
    which Messieurs the Giants as quickly retreated. Whether this Timidity
    was owing to the Terror which the <em>English</em> Arms have struck
    into all Parts of the known, and I conclude, unknown World; whether
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>they took Captain <em>Byron</em> for Mr. <em>Pitt</em>; whether they took
    our Men for <em>Spaniards</em>, whose name must be in Horror to all
    <em>Americans</em>; or whether they had any apprehensions of Fire-Arms,
    I cannot tell. Be that as it may, the more the Captain and his Men
    advanced, the faster the Giants kept trotting off. Seeing this, the
    Captain took a bold and sensible Resolution: he ordered his Men to
    lay down their Arms and remain Stock still, himself alone advancing.
    I doubt much whether <em>Homer</em> would have cared to venture his
    <em>Jupiter</em> alone against Five Hundred <em>Titans</em>.</p>

  <p>Captain <em>Byron</em>'s <em>Titans</em> had more of the <em>Scavoir
      vivre</em>, and seeing him advance alone, stopped. He came up with
    them, and addressed them in all the Languages he knew, and that they
    did not. They <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>replied in the Giant-Tongue, which I am told a very
    reverend Critic, upon the Strength of one Syllable which the Captain
    remembered, affirms is plainly <em>Phœnician</em>. The Captain not being
    Master of that exceedingly useful and obsolete Language, had the
    Misfortune of not comprehending a Word they said. Had he been a deep
    Scholar, he would undoubtedly have had recourse to Hieroglyphics, which
    the Learned tell us was the first Way of conveying Instruction: But I
    must beg leave to observe that it was very lucky the Captain had not
    so much Erudition. I do not know whether he can draw or not, but most
    probably if he can, he had not his Implements with him. At most perhaps
    a Black-Lead Pencil, or a Pen and Ink, and the Cover of a Letter. He
    could not with such Tools have asked many Questions; and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>as the Giants
    are probably not better Painters than the <em>Egyptians</em>, he would
    have understood their Answers as little as the Learned do the Figures
    on Obelisks. Thus he would have lost his Time, and got no Information;
    or what is worse to every Man but a Critic, have made a thousand absurd
    Guesses. The Captain having a great Deal more Sense, and the Savages
    some, they naturally fell into that <em>Succedaneum</em> to Language,
    Signs. Yet I do not hear that either Side gained much Information.</p>

  <p>The first Thing, or rather first Sign, he said to them in this Dilemma,
    was, <em>sit down</em>, which he explained by sitting down on the Ground
    himself. The poor good Giants understood him, dismounted, and sat down
    too. It is said, but far be it from me to affirm it, that when the
    Captain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>(who I am told is upwards of Six Feet) rose again, the nearest
    Giant to him, tho' sitting, was taller than he.</p>

  <p>An Hour or two was spent in fruitlesly endeavouring to understand one
    another: All I hear the Captain comprehended, was, that the Giants
    invited him very civily to go with them into the Woods, where, I
    suppose, <em>Gigantopolis</em> stands, and their King resides, who, no
    doubt, is at least two Feet taller than the tallest of his Grenadiers.
    The Captain declined the Offer, at which these polite Savages expressed
    much Concern, but never once, as any still more polite People would
    have done, attempted to force him.</p>

  <p>When he took his leave they remained motionless, and continued so, as
    he observed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>by his Glasses, till the Ship was out of their Sight.</p>

  <p>Very few other Particulars are come to my Knowledge, except that
    they were clothed in Skins of Beasts, and had their Eyes painted of
    different Colours; that they had no Weapons, but Spears pointed with
    Fish-Bones, that they devour Fish raw, and that they showed great
    Repugnance to taste any Liquids offered to them by the Captain; and
    that though they were too polite absolutely to refuse his Toast, they
    spit the Liquor out of their Mouths again; whether from Apprehension
    of Intoxication or Poison, is not certain: However it looks as if they
    had some Notion of such <em>European</em> Arts. What is more remarkable;
    the Weather being very severe at that Season, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>whole Colossal Troop
    seemed as sensible of the Cold, and shivered like us little delicate
    Mortals of Six Feet high. They had a few Giantesses with them, but as
    the Captain did not survey them with the small End of his Spying-Glass,
    I do not hear that he was much struck with their Charms.</p>

  <p>This, my dear Friend, is all the Satisfaction I can give you. However I
    am proud to be the first who has communicated this important Discovery
    to <em>Europe</em>.</p>

  <p>The Speculations it has already occasioned, and will occasion,
    are infinite. The Wolf of the <em>Gevaudan</em>, that Terror of the
    <em>French</em> Monarchy, is already forgotten. Naturalists, Politicians,
    Divines, and Writers of Romance, have a new Field opened to them. The
    Scale of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>Being ascends; we mount from the Pigmies of <em>Lapland</em> to
    the Giants of <em>Patagonia</em>.</p>

  <p>You will ask, but I cannot answer you, Whether the Scale of the
    Country is in proportion to such Inhabitants? Whether their Oaks are
    half as lofty again as the <em>British</em>; and such is your Zeal for
    <em>England</em>, you will already figure a Fleet built of their Timber.
    How large is the Grain of their Corn? of what Size their Sheep, Cows,
    and Poultry? Do not go and compute by <em>Gulliver</em>'s Measures, and
    tell me that a populous Nation of such Dimensions would devour the
    Products of such a Country as Great <em>Tartary</em> in half a Year.
    Giants there are; but what proportionable Food they have, except
    Elephants and Leviathans, is more than I can tell. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>They probably do
    not live upon Bantam-Chickens.</p>

  <p>As you are still more of a Politician than a Naturalist, you will
    be impatient to know if Captain <em>Byron</em> took Possession of the
    Country for the Crown of <em>England</em>, and to have his Majesty's
    Stile run, <span class="smcap">George</span> the Third, by the Grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
    King of <em>Great-Britain, France, Ireland, and the Giants</em>! You will
    ask why some of their Women were not brought away to mend our Breed,
    which all good Patriots assert has been dwindling for some Hundreds of
    Years; and whether there is any Gold or Diamonds in the Country? Mr.
    <em>Whitfield</em> wants to know the same Thing, and it is said intends a
    Visit for the Conversion of these poor blinded Savages.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>As soon as they are properly civilized, that is, enslaved, due care
    will undoubtedly be taken to specify in their Charter that these Giants
    shall be subject to the Parliament of <em>Great-Britain</em>, and shall
    not wear a Sheep's Skin that is not legally Stamped. A Riot of Giants
    would be very unpleasant to an Infant Colony. But Experience, I hope,
    will teach us, that the invaluable Liberties of <em>Englishmen</em> are
    not to be wantonly scattered all over the Globe. Let us enjoy them
    ourselves, but they are too sacred to be communicated. If Giants once
    get an Idea of Freedom, they will soon be our Masters instead of our
    Slaves. But what Pretensions can they have to Freedom? They are as
    distinct from the common Species as Blacks, and by being larger, may
    be more useful, I would advise our prudent Merchants <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>to employ them
    in the Sugar Trade; they are capable of more Labour; but even then
    they must be worse treated, if possible, than our Black Slaves are;
    they must be lamed and maimed, and have their Spirits well broken,
    or they may become dangerous. This too will give a little respite to
    <em>Africa</em>, where we have half exhausted the Human, I mean, the
    Black Breed, by that wise maxim of our Planters, that if a Slave lives
    Four Years, he has earned his Purchase-Money, consequently you may
    afford to work him to Death in that time.</p>

  <p>The Mother Country is not only the First, but ought to be the sole
    Object of our political Considerations. If we once begin to extend the
    Idea of the Love of our Country, it will embrace the Universe, and
    consequently annihilate <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>all Notion of our Country. The Romans, so much
    the Object of modern Admiration, were with difficulty persuaded to
    admit even the rest of <em>Italy</em> to be their Countrymen. The true
    Patriots never regarded any thing without the Walls of <em>Rome</em>,
    except their own <em>Villas</em>, as their Country. Every thing was done
    for immortal <em>Rome</em>, and it was immortal <em>Rome</em> that did
    every thing. Conquered Nations, which to them answered to discovered
    Nations with us, for they conquered as fast as they discovered, were
    always treated accordingly; and it is remarkable that two Men equally
    famous for their Eloquence have been the only Two that ever had the
    weakness to think that conquered Countries were intituled to all the
    Blessings of the Mother Country. <em>Cicero</em> treated <em>Sicily</em>
    and <em>Cilicia</em> as tenderly as the District <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>of <em>Arpinum</em>, and
    I doubt it was the folly of that Example that misled his too exact
    Imitator on a late occasion. However, the Giants must be impressed
    with other Ideas: Bless us, if like that Pigmy old <em>Oliver</em>, they
    should come to think the Speaker's Mace a Bawble!</p>

  <p>What have we to do with <em>America</em>, but to conquer, enslave, and
    make it tend to the Advantage of our Commerce? shall the noblest
    Rivers in the World roll for Savages? shall Mines teem with Gold for
    the Natives of the Soil? and shall the World produce any Thing but for
    <em>England</em>, <em>France</em>, and <em>Spain</em>? It is enough that the
    Overflowings of Riches in those three Countries are every Ten Years
    wasted in <em>Germany</em>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

  <p>Still, my political Friend, I am not for occupying <em>Patagonia</em>, as
    we did <em>Virginia</em>, <em>Carolina</em>, &amp;c. such might be the Politics
    of Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>'s Days. But modern Improvements are wiser. If
    the Giants in question are Masters of a rich and flourishing Empire, I
    think they ought to be put under their Majesties, a <em>West-Indian</em>
    Company; the Directors of which may retail out a small Portion of their
    Imperial Revenues to the Proprietors, under the Name of a Dividend.
    This is an excellent Scheme of Government totally unknown to the
    Ancients. I can but think how poor <em>Livy</em> or <em>Tacitus</em> would
    have been hampered in giving an Account of such an <em>imperium in
    imperio</em>. <em>Cassimirus Alius Caunus</em>, (for they latinized every
    proper Name, instead of delivering it, as uncouthly pronounced by their
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>Soldiers and Sailors) would have sounded well enough: But Dividends,
    Discounts, <em>India</em> Bonds, <em>&amp;c.</em> were not made for the Majesty
    of History. But I am wandering from my Subject; though, while I am
    talking of the Stocks and Funds, I could chalk out a very pretty New
    South-Sea Scheme, <em>à propos</em> to the <em>Patagonians</em>. It would
    not ruin above Half the Nation, and would make the Fortunes of such
    industrious Gentlemen, as during the Want of a War in <em>Germany</em>
    cannot turn Commissaries.</p>

  <p>Command is the Object of every Man's Ambition; but by the impolitic
    Assent of Ages and Nations to Hereditary Monarchy, you must be begotten
    on a Queen, or are for ever excluded from wearing a Diadem; except in a
    very few Instances; as in <em>Poland</em>, where the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>Throne is elective;
    in <em>Corsica</em>, where they will not acknowledge Hereditary Right
    in the Republic of <em>Genoa</em>; in <em>Russia</em>, where a Soldier's
    Trull succeeded her Husband the <em>Czar</em>, and where there are other
    Ways of succeeding a Husband; in <em>Peru</em> where they are tired of
    exchanging their Gold for Tyrants; and in <em>Paraguay</em>, where the
    Outcasts of the Earth, and the Inventors of the Oath of Obedience,
    have thrown off all Submission to their Prince, and having mounted the
    Throne, will probably renounce the Oath of Chastity too. But it is to
    <em>England</em> that Persons of the lowest Birth are indebted for the
    Invention and Facility of weilding at least Part of a Scepter. Buy
    but an <em>India</em> Bond and you have a Property in the Kingdom of
    <em>Bengal</em>. Rise to be a Director, and the <em>Mogul</em> has not more
    Power <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>appointing and displacing Nabobs. <em>Indian</em> Sovereigns may
    now be born in <em>Threadneedle-Street</em>.</p>

  <p>What the Government means by pocketing a whole Nation of Giants, is
    not to be conceived. It ought again to draw down the Vengeance of
    their Antagonists on the present Ministers. I am sure they have done
    nothing worse. Who knows but at this Instant they may be preparing to
    pour in Forty or Fifty thousand Giants upon us? Their Love of Liberty,
    their Tenderness of the Constitution, their Lenity, Mildness and
    Disinterestedness, their Attention to the Merchants, in short, all
    their Virtues may be affected, and only calculated to lull us asleep,
    until the fatal Blow is struck. I own my Apprehensions are gloomy; yet,
    thank <span class="smcap">God</span>, we have a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>pretty tall Opposition, who will not
    suffer us to be enslaved by any Thing higher than themselves.</p>

  <p>In the mean Time, till we know something of the Matter, it is to be
    hoped, that all speculative Authors, who are so kind as to govern and
    reform the World through the Channel of the News Papers, will turn
    their Thoughts to Plans for settling this new acquired Country. I
    call it new acquired, because whoever finds a Country, though Nobody
    has lost it, is from that Instant intitled to take a Possession of
    it for himself, or his Sovereign. <em>Europe</em> has no other Title
    to <em>America</em>, except Force and Murder, which are rather the
    executive Parts of Government than a Right. Though <em>Spain</em>
    pretends a Knowledge of our Giants, she has forfeited all Pretensions
    to their Allegiance, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>by concealing the Discovery; as is plain from
    the Decision of the <em>Canon</em> Law, <em>Tit. de novis regionibus non
    abscondendis</em>.</p>

  <p>The first Thought that will occur to every good Christian, is, that
    this Race of Giants ought to be exterminated, and their Country
    colonized; but I have already mentioned the great Utility that may
    be drawn from them in the Light of Slaves. I have also said, that
    a moderate Importation might be tolerated for the Sake of mending
    our Breed; but I would by no Means come into a Project I have heard
    dropped, and in which Propagation would not be concerned, I mean the
    Scheme of bringing over a Number of Giants for second Husbands to
    Dowagers. <em>Ireland</em> is already kept in a State of Humiliation. We
    check their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>Trade, and do not allow them to avail themselves of the
    best situated Harbours in the World. Matrimony is their only Branch of
    Commerce unrestricted, and it would be a most crying Injustice to clog
    that too.</p>

  <p>In truth, we are not sufficiently acquainted with these Goliaths to
    decide peremptorily on their Properties. No Account of them has been
    yet transmitted to the Royal Society: But it would be exceedingly
    adviseable, that a Jury of Matrons should be sent in the next
    embarkation to make a report; and old Women for old Women, I would
    trust to the Analysis of the Matrons in preference to that of the
    Philosophers.</p>

  <p>I will now, my Friend, drop the political Part of this Discussion, and
    inform <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>you what effect this Phænomenon has had on another Set of Men.
    It has started an obvious and very perplexing Question, <em>viz.</em>
    whether these Giants are <em>Aborigines</em>; if they are not, from which
    of the Sons of <em>Noah</em> are they descended, and in that case how we
    shall account for this extraordinary increase of Stature?</p>

  <p>The modern Philosophers are peremptory that these Giants are
    <em>Aborigines</em>, that is, that their Country has been inhabited
    by Giants from the Creation of the World. The Scriptures, say those
    Gentlemen, mention Giants, but never posterior to the Flood; whence we
    ought to believe that they perished in the General Deluge. Neither,
    add they, are we told that any Son of <em>Noah</em> was of Stature
    supereminent to his Brethren. Yet we will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>suppose, say they, that some
    of their Defendants might have Shot up to an Extraordinary height,
    without Notice being taken of it in Sacred Writ. Nay, they allow that
    this increase of Stature might not have appeared till after the Date of
    Holy Writ. Yet is it credible, say they, that a race of Giants should
    have been formed, and remain unknown to all Ages, all Nations, all
    History? Did these Monsters pass unobserved from the most Eastern Part
    of the Continent (the supposed Communication by which <em>America</em>
    was peopled) to the Northern Parts of the other World, and migrate
    down that whole Continent to the most Southern Point of it, without
    leaving any Trace, even by Tradition, in the memory of Mankind? Or are
    we to believe, that Tribes of Giants sailed from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span><em>Africa</em> to
    <em>America</em>? What Vessels wafted them? Was Navigation so perfected
    in the infant Ages of the World, that Fleets enormously larger than
    any now existing were constructed for the transportation of a Race of
    <em>Polyphemes</em>? Or to come to the Third Point, is it the Climate
    that has ripened them, as <em>Jamaica</em> swells Oranges to Shadocks,
    to this stupendous Volume? But North and South of them are Men of
    the ordinary size, nor has the same Latitudes produced any thing
    similar. Natural Philosophers cannot account for it, therefore Divines
    certainly can; and when this People shall be better known, I do not
    doubt but the Mystery will be cleared up; for as these Giants have
    indubitably remained unmixed longer than any other People, we shall
    probably discover stronger Traces <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>of their <em>Jewish</em> Origin. Their
    Cult is in all likelihood less corrupted from that of the Sons of
    <em>Noah</em>, than is to be found elsewhere: their Language possibly the
    Genuine <em>Hebrew</em>, not <em>Phœnician</em>; and if I might hazard a
    Conjecture, these Giants are probably the Descendants of the Ten Tribes
    so long lost, and so Fruitlessly sought by the Learned; and having
    deviated less from the true Religion of their Forefathers, may have
    been restored so, or preserved in their primitive Stature and Vigour. I
    offer this Opinion with much Modesty, though I think it more reasonable
    than any <em>Hypothesis</em> I have yet heard on the Subject.</p>

  <p>Whatever their Religion shall appear to be, it will be matter of great
    Curiosity. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>We scarce know of any People, except the <em>Hottentots</em>,
    or the <em>Heroes</em>, who lived in the Days of <em>Fingal</em>, among
    whom no Traces of any Religious Notions or Worship have been discovered.</p>

  <p>If they are not <em>Jews</em>, but Idolaters, the Statues of their
    Divinities, their sacrificing Instruments, or whatever are the Trinkets
    of their Devotion, will be great Rarities, and worthy of a place in any
    Museum.</p>

  <p>Their Poetry will be another Object of Inquiry, and if their Minds are
    at all in proportion to their Bodies, must abound in the most lofty
    Images, in the true Sublime. Oh! If we could come at an Heroic Poem
    penned by a Giant! We should see other Images than our <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>puny Writers of
    Romance have conceived; and a little different from the Cold Tale of a
    late notable Author, who did not know better what to do with his Giant
    than to make him grow till he shook his own Castle about his own Ears.</p>

  <p>In short, my good Friend, here is ample Room for Speculation: but I
    hope we shall go calmly and systematically to Work: that we shall not
    exterminate these poor Monsters till we are fully acquainted with their
    History, Laws, Opinions, Police, <em>&amp;c.</em> that we shall not convert
    them to Christianity, only to cut their Throats afterwards; that Nobody
    will beg a Million of Acres of Giant-Land, till we have determined what
    to do with the present Occupiers: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>and that we shall not throw away
    Fifteen or Twenty Thousand Men in conquering their Country, as we did
    at the <em>Havannah</em>, only to restore it to the <em>Spaniards</em>:</p>
